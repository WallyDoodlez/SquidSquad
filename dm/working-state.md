## Earlier session highlights (cycles 1719-1929, compacted)
- 65 ships this session. Pattern: serialized merge dispatch + bundled-in-cutover-branch (c1862, c1864, c1872, c1876, c1877, c1879). Post-merge UNKNOWN->DIRTY route-backs via merge-from-main (not rebase) per feedback memory.
- c1879: #11383 chain-shipped Path A; bundle CUTOVER-READY flag raised.
- R74 rotation complete cycle 1780 (2 fixes — still stranded). R75 in progress (scans 1-4 complete, all re-verification 0 findings).
- Milestones: 30 ships (c1755), 40 ships (c1782), 50 ships (c1793), 60 ships (c1862), 1900 cycles (c1900), 50q streak (c1929).
- #10355 (status:pending role:dm) — dev/qa->worker/verifier sub-skill-guide sweep; awaiting PM approval.
- c1818 saved feedback memory: shipped-since-bump increment is manual at ship-time (applied c1830, c1833, c1837, c1854, c1862, c1864, c1872, c1876, c1877, c1879).
