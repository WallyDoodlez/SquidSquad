## Vault — Shared Memory Layer

All agents have read/write access to the shared knowledge vault at `.squidsquad/vault/`. The vault stores institutional knowledge — decisions, patterns, learnings, preferences, and context that shapes the squad's behavior over time. It follows the **PARAG** structure:

```
.squidsquad/vault/
├── projects/       # Active project context, goals, constraints
├── areas/          # Ongoing concerns: human preferences, code conventions,
│                   # design system, company values, team culture
├── resources/      # Reference material, external docs, research
├── archives/       # Shipped features, closed decisions, historical context
└── galaxy/         # Atomic knowledge notes (Zettelkasten):
                    # decisions, patterns, learnings, styles
```

### Vault Initialization (vault-init)

If `.squidsquad/vault/` does not exist, initialize it:

1. Create the 5 PARAG directories: `projects/`, `areas/`, `resources/`, `archives/`, `galaxy/`
2. Add `.gitkeep` files to empty directories (`resources/.gitkeep`, `archives/.gitkeep`) so git tracks them
3. Create `BRIEFING.md` from the template at `references/vault-templates/BRIEFING.md` — pre-populate with current project context from `config.md`
4. Create initial `areas/human-profile.md` from the areas template — seed with any known human preferences (can be minimal stub initially)
5. Create `projects/{project-name}.md` from the projects template — seed with project info from `config.md`
6. Create `.squidsquad/vault/.obsidian/` directory and add it to `.gitignore` (Obsidian's config is per-user, not shared)

vault-init is **idempotent** — re-running it creates missing directories and files but never overwrites existing vault content.

### Entity Model

| Entity | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Human profile | `areas/human-profile.md` | Preferences, values, communication style |
| Company context | `areas/company-context.md` | Culture, standards, brand guidelines |
| Design system | `areas/design-system.md` | Colors, tokens, typography, component patterns |
| Code conventions | `areas/code-conventions.md` | Style, patterns, architecture decisions |
| Project context | `projects/{name}.md` | Goals, constraints, architecture, tech stack |
| Decisions | `galaxy/decision-*.md` | Individual architectural/design/process decisions |
| Patterns | `galaxy/pattern-*.md` | Recurring approaches, established conventions |
| Learnings | `galaxy/learning-*.md` | Lessons learned, what worked/didn't |
| Styles | `galaxy/style-*.md` | Visual style, writing tone, code style preferences |

### Creating Notes (vault-create)

To create a vault note:

1. Determine the correct folder based on note type (galaxy/ for atomic knowledge, areas/ for ongoing concerns, etc.)
2. Name the file descriptively using kebab-case with a type prefix for galaxy notes: `decision-use-rest-over-graphql.md`, `pattern-error-handling.md`, `learning-cache-invalidation.md`. Valid galaxy type prefixes: `decision-`, `pattern-`, `learning-`, `style-`. Agents may introduce new prefixes if needed — document them in the Changelog.
3. Copy the folder's template (from `references/vault-templates/`) and fill in:
   - **YAML frontmatter**: type, tags, created (today), updated (today), owner (your role), status (`active`), confidence, source, links
   - **`links` field format**: Use bare note names as a YAML list: `links: [note-name-a, note-name-b]`. Do NOT use wikilink syntax in frontmatter. Wikilinks (`[[note-name]]`) go in the body's Related section only. The `links` field is for machine parsing; the Related section is for human reading.
   - **`source` field**: How this knowledge was captured. Values: `conversation` (from human discussion), `code` (observed in codebase), `review` (from code/design review), `observation` (inferred from patterns), `research` (from external sources). Not exhaustive — use the closest match.
   - **Body sections**: fill per template structure
   - **Changelog**: initial entry with date, your role, and brief context
4. Use **bare wikilinks** only in the body: `[[note-name]]` — no alias syntax
5. **Creation threshold**: Only create a note if the insight is reusable across contexts. Transient observations (one-time debugging steps, ephemeral state) belong in iteration logs, not the vault.

### Confidence Levels

- **high**: Human explicitly stated or confirmed this
- **medium**: Agent observed this directly (e.g., from code review, conversation patterns)
- **low**: Agent inferred this (e.g., from indirect signals, extrapolation)

### Wikilinks

Use `[[note-name]]` (bare, no aliases) to link related notes in the body. Links create a knowledge graph browsable in Obsidian and traversable via grep:

```bash
# Find all notes linking TO a given note
grep -rl '\[\[note-name\]\]' .squidsquad/vault/

# Find what a note links TO
grep -o '\[\[[^]]*\]\]' .squidsquad/vault/galaxy/decision-example.md
```

### BRIEFING.md

`.squidsquad/vault/BRIEFING.md` is a ~50 line summary of active context, injected at session start. It contains:
- Current project priorities and active work
- Recent important decisions
- Key human preferences summary (reference `[[human-profile]]` if it exists — this link is optional during early vault setup)
- Active constraints or blockers

BRIEFING.md is auto-maintained — agents update it when **significant** context changes (new project priorities, major decisions, constraint changes). Minor cycle-to-cycle updates do NOT warrant a BRIEFING.md edit. It is NOT a full knowledge dump — it is a focused briefing for the current moment.

### Concurrent Access

Multiple agents may write to the vault simultaneously. Git handles merge conflicts at the file level. To minimize conflicts:

- **One note per topic** — don't append to other agents' notes. Create your own note and link to theirs.
- **Append-only changelogs** — like Discussion entries, Changelog entries are append-only. Git can auto-merge appends to the same file.
- **If a merge conflict occurs**: Keep both versions. Append the conflicting section below the existing one. Never discard vault content.

### Note Size Guidance

- **Galaxy notes**: Atomic — one idea per note, max ~500 lines. If a note grows beyond this, split it.
- **Area notes** (human-profile, design-system, etc.): Can grow freely — these are living documents.
- **Project notes**: Keep focused on active context. Archive historical sections to `archives/` when no longer current.
- **Resource notes**: No hard limit, but prefer linking to external sources over copying large amounts of content.

### Updating Notes (vault-update)

To update an existing vault note:

1. **Read the full note first** — never update a note you haven't read in this cycle.
2. **Modify only the targeted section(s)** — preserve all other sections exactly as they are. vault-update is a surgical edit, not a rewrite.
3. **Never delete existing content** — add to sections, don't remove from them. If content is wrong, add a correction; if superseded, mark it as such in the body and update `status` in frontmatter.
4. **Update the `updated` frontmatter field** to today's date.
5. **Append a Changelog entry** describing what changed and why:
   ```
   - YYYY-MM-DD — Updated by [agent]. [What changed and why].
   ```
6. **Run vault-check Level 1** on the note after updating (see vault-check below).

vault-update preserves the note's identity — same filename, same `created` date, same `owner`. Only `updated`, the targeted body section(s), and the Changelog grow.

### Searching the Vault (vault-search)

vault-search finds notes by tag, type, keyword, or wikilink traversal. It uses grep internally but presents a generic interface — agents call vault-search without knowing the implementation. A future SQLite/RAG backend (FEAT-SKILL-062) can replace the internals without changing how agents invoke search.

**Search modes:**

1. **By tag**: Find notes whose `tags` frontmatter contains a specific tag.
   ```bash
   grep -rl "tags:.*\b<TAG>\b" .squidsquad/vault/ --include="*.md"
   ```

2. **By type**: Find notes with a specific `type` frontmatter value.
   ```bash
   grep -rl "^type: <TYPE>" .squidsquad/vault/ --include="*.md"
   ```

3. **By keyword** (full-text): Find notes containing a phrase.
   ```bash
   grep -rl "<KEYWORD>" .squidsquad/vault/ --include="*.md"
   ```

4. **By wikilink traversal**: Starting from a note, find connected notes.
   - **1-hop**: Outbound links (wikilinks in the note's body) + inbound links (other notes linking to this one).
     ```bash
     # Outbound: extract wikilinks from the note
     grep -o '\[\[[^]]*\]\]' .squidsquad/vault/<path> | sed 's/\[\[//g;s/\]\]//g'
     # Inbound: find notes linking TO this note
     grep -rl '\[\[<note-name>\]\]' .squidsquad/vault/ --include="*.md"
     ```
   - **2-hop**: For each 1-hop result, repeat the outbound+inbound search. Do NOT traverse beyond 2 hops.

**Result format**: Return a list of matching note paths with a brief excerpt (first non-frontmatter content line). **Max 10 results** — if more match, return the 10 most recently updated (sort by `updated` frontmatter). The agent can narrow and re-search.

**Caching**: Within a single cycle, cache search results to avoid repeated grep calls for the same query.

### Checking Vault Health (vault-check)

vault-check validates vault notes for correctness and consistency. Two levels:

#### Level 1 — Single Note + 2-Hop Neighborhood

Runs **automatically after every vault-create or vault-update**. Checks the written note and all notes within 2 wikilink hops.

For each note checked:

1. **Required frontmatter fields**: `type`, `tags`, `created`, `updated`, `owner`, `status`, `confidence`. Warn if any are missing or empty.
2. **Type-folder match**: Galaxy notes (`galaxy/`) must have type `decision`, `pattern`, `learning`, or `style`. Area notes (`areas/`) must have type `area`. Project notes (`projects/`) must have type `project`. Warn on mismatch.
3. **Wikilink resolution**: Parse all `[[note-name]]` in the body. For each, verify a file named `note-name.md` exists somewhere in `.squidsquad/vault/`. Warn for each unresolved wikilink.
4. **Auto-maintain `links` frontmatter**: Parse all `[[note-name]]` from the note's body. Update the `links` field in frontmatter to match (bare names, YAML list). This is automatic — agents do not manually curate the `links` field.
5. **Galaxy note size**: If the note is in `galaxy/` and exceeds 500 lines, warn and suggest splitting. Do NOT warn for notes in `areas/`, `projects/`, or `resources/`.

Print warnings with `[vault-check]` prefix. If no issues found, print nothing (silent pass).

#### Level 2 — Full Vault Sweep

Runs on-demand (invoked explicitly, not automatic). Checks every `.md` file in `.squidsquad/vault/`:

1. Run all Level 1 checks on every note.
2. **Orphan detection**: Find notes with zero inbound wikilinks that are not area notes. Area notes and BRIEFING.md are exempt — they serve as entry points.
3. **Staleness detection**: Find notes with `status: active` and `updated` date older than 30 days. Flag as potentially stale.
4. **Broken link census**: Aggregate all unresolved wikilinks across the vault.
5. **Health summary**: Print totals — note count, orphan count, stale count, broken link count.

```bash
# Quick orphan check: find notes never linked TO
for f in .squidsquad/vault/galaxy/*.md; do
  name=$(basename "$f" .md)
  if ! grep -rl "\[\[$name\]\]" .squidsquad/vault/ --include="*.md" -q 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "[vault-check] Orphan: $f"
  fi
done
```

### Rules

- All vault notes are **git-tracked** — full version history
- Galaxy notes should be **atomic** (one idea per note, max ~500 lines)
- Area notes can grow freely (human-profile, design-system, etc.)
- Every note must have the **confidence** field
- Always append to the **Changelog** section when modifying a note
- The vault is browsable in the **Obsidian app** — maintain clean structure
- Empty directories use `.gitkeep` to persist in git
- **vault-check Level 1 runs after every write** — vault-create and vault-update both trigger it
- **vault-update never deletes content** — only adds, corrects, or marks as superseded
