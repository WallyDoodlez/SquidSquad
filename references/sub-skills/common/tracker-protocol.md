## Tracker Protocol — GitHub Issues

All bugs and features are tracked as GitHub Issues with structured labels. Agents use the `gh` CLI to create, read, update, and comment on Issues. No internal markdown tracker files — GitHub Issues is the single source of truth.

### Startup Permission Check

At agent boot (before the first cycle), verify `gh` access:

```bash
gh issue list --limit 1 2>&1
```

If this fails (authentication error, missing scope, `gh` not found):
1. Print: `[🦑] ERROR: GitHub Issues permission check failed. Run "gh auth refresh" with "repo" scope, or ensure gh CLI is installed and authenticated.`
2. Exit the conversation. SquidSquad requires GitHub Issues access.

If `gh` works but GitHub is **temporarily unreachable** during a cycle (network blip), skip tracker operations for this cycle and retry next cycle. Print: `[🦑] GitHub unreachable — skipping tracker operations. Will retry next cycle.`

### Label Taxonomy

Issues use labels for structured metadata. The following labels must exist on the repo (created during setup):

**Type:**
- `bug` — defect, regression, broken behavior
- `feature` — new capability or enhancement

**Priority:**
- `priority:high` — urgent, blocks other work
- `priority:medium` — normal priority
- `priority:low` — nice-to-have, improvement scan items

**Status:**
- `status:pending` — filed, awaiting human approval
- `status:planning` — approved by human, PM running intake
- `status:planned` — planning complete, awaiting human approval for execution
- `status:approved` — human approved, ready for dev pickup
- `status:in-progress` — agent actively working
- `status:pending-test` — implementation complete, awaiting QA
- `status:pending-ship` — QA verified, awaiting DM delivery
- `status:shipped` — delivered, closed

**Role (assignee domain):**
- `role:skill` (or `role:fe`, `role:be`, etc.) — dev agent
- `role:pm` — PM agent
- `role:qa` — QA agent
- `role:designer` — designer agent
- `role:dm` — DM agent

**Design (for features needing design):**
- `design:needed` — designer must produce specs before dev
- `design:in-progress` — designer working on specs
- `design:complete` — design approved, dev can proceed

**Severity (for bugs):**
- `severity:high` — critical, blocks usage
- `severity:medium` — degraded functionality
- `severity:low` — cosmetic, minor annoyance

**Special:**
- `squidsquad` — all SquidSquad-managed items get this label
- `improvement-scan` — filed by improvement scanning (quiet cycle)

### Reading Issues (replaces INDEX.md scanning)

To list issues by status and role:

```bash
# List approved features for your role
gh issue list --label "type:feature,status:approved,role:[ROLE]" --json number,title,labels --limit 50

# List open bugs for your role
gh issue list --label "type:bug,role:[ROLE]" --json number,title,labels --limit 50

# List all items pending test across all agents (for QA)
gh issue list --label "status:pending-test" --json number,title,labels --limit 50

# List pending ship items (for DM)
gh issue list --label "status:pending-ship" --json number,title,labels --limit 50
```

To read a specific issue:

```bash
gh issue view [NUMBER] --json title,body,labels,comments
```

### Creating Issues (replaces filing bugs/features)

```bash
# File a bug
gh issue create --title "BUG: [title]" \
  --body "[description, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual]" \
  --label "type:bug,severity:[level],role:[target-role],squidsquad,status:pending"

# File a feature
gh issue create --title "FEAT: [title]" \
  --body "[description, acceptance criteria]" \
  --label "type:feature,priority:[level],role:[target-role],squidsquad,status:pending"
```

After creating, note the returned Issue number for reference.

### Status Transitions (replaces editing Status field)

Use label removal + addition to transition status:

```bash
# Example: Approved → In Progress
gh issue edit [NUMBER] --remove-label "status:approved" --add-label "status:in-progress"

# Example: In Progress → Pending Test
gh issue edit [NUMBER] --remove-label "status:in-progress" --add-label "status:pending-test"

# Example: Pending Ship → Shipped (close the issue)
gh issue edit [NUMBER] --remove-label "status:pending-ship" --add-label "status:shipped"
gh issue close [NUMBER]
```

### Discussion Entries (replaces inline Discussion sections)

Discussion entries become Issue comments. Same format — timestamped and role-signed:

```bash
gh issue comment [NUMBER] --body "> [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] **[role]**: [message]"
```

Comments are append-only — never edit or delete previous comments.

### Design Field (replaces **Design**: field in markdown)

Design status is tracked via labels:

```bash
# PM sets design needed
gh issue edit [NUMBER] --add-label "design:needed"

# Designer picks up
gh issue edit [NUMBER] --remove-label "design:needed" --add-label "design:in-progress"

# Designer completes
gh issue edit [NUMBER] --remove-label "design:in-progress" --add-label "design:complete"
```

Dev agents skip issues with `design:needed` or `design:in-progress` labels.

### Working State References

Reference issues by number in working-state.md: `- **Task**: #42`

### Planning Artifacts

Planning artifacts (RESEARCH.md, CONTEXT.md, TEST-PLAN.md) remain as local files in `.squidsquad/[role]/planning/`. Only the tracker (bugs/features) moves to GitHub Issues. Reference the Issue number in artifact filenames or content for traceability.

### Caching

Within a single cycle, cache `gh issue list` results to avoid repeated API calls. Read the list once at the start of the relevant step, then operate on the cached data.
