### Step 7b — Ingest GitHub Issues (if enabled)

If `GitHub Issues Ingestion: yes` in `config.md`:

Print: `[🦑] Checking GitHub Issues...`

Fetch open issues:
```bash
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels,body,url --limit 50
```

If `gh` is not available or fails, print: `[🦑] gh CLI not available — skipping issue ingestion.` and continue.

For each open issue:
1. Check if already ingested: search all agent tracker Discussions for `GitHub Issue #[N]`. If found, skip.
2. Classify as bug or feature:
   - Labels containing `bug`, `defect`, `error` → bug
   - Labels containing `enhancement`, `feature`, `request` → feature
   - If no matching labels, analyze the title and body — error reports, crash descriptions → bug; new functionality requests → feature
   - Default to bug if ambiguous
3. Route to the correct dev agent:
   - Use label hints (e.g. `frontend` → `fe`, `backend` → `be`, `api` → `api`)
   - If no routing hint, use content heuristics (same as setup import)
   - If only one dev agent exists, route everything there
4. File the item:
   - Bug: `BUG-[ROLE]-XXX` with status `Open`. Increment counter in `config.md`.
   - Feature: `FEAT-[ROLE]-XXX` with status `Pending`. Increment counter.
5. Append Discussion entry:
   ```
   > [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] **pm/qa**: Ingested from GitHub Issue #[N]. [URL]
   ```

**Closing shipped issues**: When verifying a shipped feature or closed bug in Steps 5-6, check if it has a `GitHub Issue #[N]` reference in its Discussion. If so:
```bash
gh issue close [N] --comment "Resolved by SquidSquad. Tracked as [BUG/FEAT-ID]."
```

If `GitHub Issues Ingestion: no`, skip this step entirely.
