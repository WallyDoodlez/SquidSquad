# Working State

- **Task**: none — doc-arch cluster shipped (#10004 + #10356 merged 2026-05-27)
- **Status**: idle, monitoring pipeline
- **Last Processed Event ID**: df9f33751a6a

## Pipeline snapshot (2026-05-27 cycle 1768)

- **PRs open**: 1 — **#10357** (human draft: HARNESS-ARCH §14 wt→claude direct-spawn proposal). Not actionable by PM until human un-drafts or requests review.
- **PM open issues**: 2 — #9970 (composed CLAUDE.md drift from #9925), #9969 (manifest.md entry-file naming). Both severity:medium, plan-first hold.
- **0 pending-test, 0 pending-ship, 0 external untriaged**
- **Doc-arch cluster** (#9968 / #9996 / #9998 / #9969 / #9970): closure pending — original scope largely subsumed by #10356 (AGENT-RUNTIME + COMPOSE-ARCHITECTURE + l4-curation) and #10004 (VAULT-ARCH polish + classes-vs-aliases). Re-audit deferred until human direction.

## Agent fleet health (anomaly persisting)

- **dm, qa, skill**: harness reports `bootup_complete: false`, last_cycle ~22h ago (2026-05-26T03:01). Only PM /loop cron is functional. Operator restart needed; not PM-fixable.

## This cycle's work (1768)

- Quiet (11th consecutive). State identical to 1767.

## Pending human decisions

1. **Fleet zombie state** — `python references/scripts/squidsquad_cli.py restart` (or fresh team boot).
2. **#9969 / #9970** — plan-first hold; may be partially obsolete post-#10356; needs re-audit.
3. **#10357 (HARNESS-ARCH §14 draft)** — awaiting un-draft.
