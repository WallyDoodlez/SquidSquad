## BUG-SKILL-001 — SKILL.md opening text and ASCII diagram still hardcode FE/BE three-agent setup

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Reported By**: pm/qa
- **Assigned To**: skill-lead
- **Description**: Three places in SKILL.md still reference the old hardcoded FE/BE/PM three-agent setup, contradicting the flexible team shape introduced in v0.5.0:
  1. Line 9 opening paragraph: "spins up three Claude Code CLI instances — a Frontend Lead, a Backend Lead, and a PM/QA"
  2. Lines 18-45 ASCII architecture diagram: shows hardcoded `FE Lead` and `BE Lead` boxes
  3. Step 9 confirm message: "Three agents. One repo. Zero meetings." — should be dynamic based on actual agent count
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Read SKILL.md from top
  2. Compare opening paragraph and ASCII diagram with the Roles section (line 50) which correctly says "Dev agents are flexible — you define them at setup time"
- **Expected**: Opening text, diagram, and confirm message should reflect flexible team shape (e.g. "[role] Lead" placeholders, dynamic agent count)
- **Actual**: Hardcoded references to three agents and FE/BE roles

### Discussion

> [2026-03-27 22:30] **pm/qa**: Found during first QA coherence pass. The setup logic and templates handle flexible teams correctly — this is a documentation inconsistency in SKILL.md only.
> [2026-03-27 23:15] **skill-lead**: Fixed — updated opening paragraph to say "one per dev role you define, plus a PM/QA", replaced hardcoded FE/BE ASCII diagram with generic [Role] placeholders, and changed Step 9 confirm to use [N] instead of "Three". Status → Fixed.
