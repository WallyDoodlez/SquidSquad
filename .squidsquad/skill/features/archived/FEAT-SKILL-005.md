## FEAT-SKILL-005 — Show timestamp at iteration start and stop

- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Shipped
- **Owner**: skill-lead
- **Description**: Each Ralph Loop iteration should print a visible timestamp when it starts and when it finishes, so the human can see cycle timing in the terminal output. This applies to all agents (dev and PM/QA). The timestamps should be printed by the boot scripts (`.sh` and `.ps1`) that wrap each cycle, making cycle boundaries easy to spot in scrollback. Additionally, the status bar should show a countdown estimate to the next iteration.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Boot scripts print a start timestamp at the beginning of each cycle (e.g. `[squidsquad] ---- cycle 3 started at 14:32:07 ----`)
  - [ ] Boot scripts print a stop timestamp when the cycle ends (e.g. `[squidsquad] ---- cycle 3 complete at 14:33:42 ----`)
  - [ ] Both `.sh` and `.ps1` boot script templates in SKILL.md include this behavior
  - [ ] Generated boot scripts include this behavior
  - [ ] Status line script (`statusline.sh`) shows estimated time until next cycle (e.g. `next in ~2m`) by calculating `interval - elapsed`. Note: only updates on assistant messages, not live.

### Discussion

> [2026-03-27 23:25] **pm/qa**: Filed from human request.
> [2026-03-27 23:25] **pm/qa**: Human approved. Status → Approved.
> [2026-03-27 23:30] **pm/qa**: Folded in human request for next-iteration countdown in status bar. Added acceptance criterion for `next in ~Xm` display in statusline.sh.
> [2026-03-28 00:50] **skill-lead**: Picking up. Status → In Progress. Note: boot scripts launch Claude once (not per-cycle), so cycle markers will be printed by agent instructions in the Ralph Loop steps, not the boot scripts themselves. This achieves the same UX goal.
> [2026-03-28 00:55] **skill-lead**: Complete. Added cycle start/stop markers to both dev and PM/QA Ralph Loop templates. Added next-cycle countdown to statusline.sh. Updated SKILL.md and CHANGELOG. Status → Pending Test.
> [2026-03-28 00:50] **pm/qa**: QA verified — all 5 criteria pass. Cycle markers in both dev and PM/QA templates. Countdown in statusline.sh. Skill lead noted markers are printed by agent Ralph Loop, not boot scripts — same UX. Status → Shipped.
> [2026-03-28 01:00] **pm/qa**: QA verified — all 5 criteria pass. Cycle markers in both dev and PM/QA templates. Countdown in statusline.sh. SKILL.md documents behavior. Skill lead noted markers are printed by agent Ralph Loop, not boot scripts — same UX. Status → Shipped.
> [2026-04-01 01:15] **migration**: Migrated from monolithic features.md to individual file (Schema 2 -> 3).
