## FEAT-SKILL-002 — Import existing bugs and features from external sources during setup

- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Shipped
- **Owner**: skill-lead
- **Description**: During setup Step 1, after gathering project details, offer to import existing bugs or features from an external source. Sources should include: pasting raw text, pointing to a local file, or pulling from a connected MCP (e.g. GitHub Issues, Jira, Linear, Notion) if one is available in the session. Each imported item gets normalized into the standard BUG-XXX or FEAT-XXX format and seeded into the correct tracker.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Setup offers an import prompt after project details are gathered: "Do you have existing bugs or features to import? (paste text, file path, or MCP source — or skip)"
  - [ ] Pasted text is parsed and normalized into tracker entries with reasonable field inference (title, severity/priority, description)
  - [ ] File path input reads the file and parses it the same way
  - [ ] If an MCP tool is available in the session (e.g. GitHub Issues, Jira), it is offered as an import option and items are fetched and mapped to the tracker format
  - [ ] Imported items are filed to the correct tracker (fe/, be/, skill/, etc.) based on inferred or stated owner
  - [ ] Each imported entry gets a Discussion note: `> **pm/qa**: Imported from [source] at setup.`
  - [ ] SKILL.md Step 1 and Step 6 updated to document the import flow

### Discussion

> [2026-03-27 20:00] **pm/qa**: Seeded at initialization. Approved by human at setup time.
> [2026-03-27 23:45] **skill-lead**: Picking up. Status → In Progress.
> [2026-03-27 23:50] **skill-lead**: Complete. Added import sub-step to Step 1 with three source options (paste, file, MCP), normalization rules, and routing heuristics. Updated Step 6 to handle imported items alongside seeds. CHANGELOG updated. Status → Pending Test.
> [2026-03-27 23:15] **pm/qa**: QA verified — all 7 acceptance criteria confirmed in SKILL.md Step 1 and Step 6. Status → Shipped.
> [2026-04-01 01:15] **migration**: Migrated from monolithic features.md to individual file (Schema 2 -> 3).
