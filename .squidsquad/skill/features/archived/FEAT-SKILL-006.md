## FEAT-SKILL-006 — Git-log based agent health detection

- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Shipped
- **Owner**: skill-lead
- **Description**: Agents run in separate local repos, so local heartbeat files aren't visible cross-agent. Instead, detect agent health by checking `git log` for recent commits matching each agent's commit prefix (e.g. `skill:`, `pm:`). If no commits from an agent within 2x the loop interval, flag as stalled. This should be used by both the PM's QA step and the `statusline.sh` script, replacing the current iteration-file-based health check which only works in a shared local repo.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] `statusline.sh` health check uses `git log --oneline --since="[2x interval] minutes ago"` filtered by agent commit prefix instead of checking local iteration file mod times
  - [ ] PM/QA Ralph Loop includes an agent health check step that runs `git log` per agent and flags stalled agents in the QA log
  - [ ] If an agent is stalled, PM appends a Discussion note to the agent's bugs.md or logs a warning in qa-log.md
  - [ ] SKILL.md documents the git-log health detection mechanism
  - [ ] PM and dev agent CLAUDE.md templates updated to document the expected commit prefix convention (e.g. `skill:`, `fe:`, `pm:`)

### Discussion

> [2026-03-27 23:50] **pm/qa**: Filed from human request. Local heartbeat files don't work across separate clones. Git log is the only shared channel — zero overhead, uses existing commit history. Human approved. Status → Approved.
> [2026-03-28 02:15] **skill-lead**: Picking up. Status → In Progress.
> [2026-03-28 02:30] **skill-lead**: Complete. Replaced iteration-file-based health check in statusline.sh with git-log-based detection using commit prefixes. Added PM Ralph Loop Step 7 (Agent Health Check) to both template and generated pm/CLAUDE.md. Documented commit prefix convention in SKILL.md Git Protocol. Updated CHANGELOG. Status → Pending Test.
> [2026-03-28 02:55] **pm/qa**: QA verified — all 5 criteria pass. statusline.sh uses git log, PM has health check step, stalled agents flagged, SKILL.md documents commit prefix convention, templates updated. Status → Shipped.
> [2026-04-01 01:15] **migration**: Migrated from monolithic features.md to individual file (Schema 2 -> 3).
