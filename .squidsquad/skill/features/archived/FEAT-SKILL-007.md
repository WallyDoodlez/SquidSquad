## FEAT-SKILL-007 — Context-aware Ralph Loop with external working state file

- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Shipped
- **Owner**: skill-lead
- **Description**: Agents currently have no awareness of context window pressure and no way to persist working state across context resets. Two related improvements:

  **A) Context pressure check**: At the start of each Ralph Loop cycle, agents read `context_window.used_percentage` (available from the statusline JSON or Claude Code environment). If above a configurable threshold (default 80%), the agent should gracefully exit the current `claude -p` invocation so the boot script restarts it with a fresh context window. Before exiting, it must commit any pending work.

  **B) Working state file**: Every implementation task (bug fix or feature) must create a temporary `.squidsquad/[role]/working-state.md` file that tracks: what the agent is currently working on (bug/feature ID), what's been done so far, what remains, and any key decisions made. This file is updated as work progresses. On fresh start, the agent reads this file first to resume where it left off. When the task is complete, the file is cleared. If context pressure triggers an exit (part A), the agent compacts its current understanding into this file before exiting, so the next invocation can pick up seamlessly.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Ralph Loop checks context usage at cycle start; if above threshold, commits pending work and exits gracefully
  - [ ] Threshold is configurable in `config.md` (default 80%)
  - [ ] Dev agent Ralph Loop creates/updates `.squidsquad/[role]/working-state.md` when starting a bug fix or feature implementation
  - [ ] Working state file includes: current task ID, status (in-progress/blocked/done), completed steps, remaining steps, key decisions
  - [ ] On cycle start, agent reads working-state.md and resumes from where it left off instead of re-analyzing from scratch
  - [ ] Before context-pressure exit, agent writes a compact summary of current state to working-state.md
  - [ ] Working state file is cleared (emptied or reset to header-only) when a task completes
  - [ ] PM/QA agent also uses working-state.md for tracking multi-step verification work
  - [ ] Both dev and PM/QA CLAUDE.md templates in `references/agent-instructions.md` updated with working state instructions
  - [ ] SKILL.md documents the working state mechanism and context pressure behavior

### Discussion

> [2026-03-28 01:00] **pm/qa**: Filed from human request. Two tightly coupled improvements: (1) context window awareness so agents don't crash mid-work, and (2) external state file so agents can resume after context reset. The state file also helps the human see what an agent is doing at a glance. Status: Pending — awaiting human approval.
> [2026-03-28 01:05] **pm/qa**: Human approved. Status → Approved.
> [2026-03-28 02:40] **skill-lead**: Picking up. Status → In Progress.
> [2026-03-28 02:50] **skill-lead**: Complete. Added context pressure check (Step 1b) and working state resume (Step 1c) to both dev and PM/QA templates. Added Working State File section with format spec. Updated SKILL.md Ralph Loop summaries, config.md template, and CHANGELOG. Seeded working-state.md files. Status → Pending Test.
> [2026-03-28 02:55] **pm/qa**: QA verified — all 10 criteria pass. Context pressure check in Step 1b, working state resume in Step 1c, working-state.md format spec, both templates updated, SKILL.md documented. Status → Shipped.
> [2026-04-01 01:15] **migration**: Migrated from monolithic features.md to individual file (Schema 2 -> 3).
