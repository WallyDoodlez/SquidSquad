## FEAT-SKILL-001 — Use structured prompts during setup

- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Shipped
- **Owner**: skill-lead
- **Description**: The current setup flow asks freeform questions. Replace it with Claude's `prompt_user` skill (or equivalent structured prompting pattern) so inputs are gathered cleanly, validated, and defaults are offered inline. This makes setup more reliable and easier to script.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Each setup question uses a structured prompt with a clear label, description, and default value shown
  - [ ] Invalid inputs (e.g. interval < 1, empty project name) are caught and re-prompted rather than silently accepted
  - [ ] Setup can be completed from a single natural-language sentence if all info is provided upfront (e.g. "Set up SquidSquad for kubex, BE only, 5 min interval")
  - [ ] SKILL.md Step 1 updated to reflect the new prompting approach
